# My Web Project

This project demonstrates how to link HTML and CSS files to create a simple webpage.

## How to Use

1. Download or clone the project.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser to view the webpage.
3. The CSS file (`styles.css`) is linked to the HTML file to provide styling.

## File Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the webpage.
- `styles.css`: The stylesheet that controls the appearance of the webpage.

Feel free to modify the files and experiment with the styles!
